# Andy Li (2004 - )

Andy Li is currently a 16 year old student at Sunset Highschool. 

## Passions

Andy is passionate about about computers. He became interested in these machines back when he was in 3rd grade. After asking his mom to buy [Terraria](https://terraria.org/), a 2-D RPG adventure game, he was denied. Desperate to play the game, he tried to get the game for free by searching up 'how to install terraria for free' on Yahoo. This resulted in his computer being infected with [Bonzo Buddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BonziBuddy), thermometers, browser toolbars, and other such viruses. Andy swore to never let this phoenomenon happen to his computer ever again, and so he stopped using [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/). He is also passionate about Minecraft, food, [rustlang](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and sleeping. 

## Sources of Pride

Andy is proud that he has survived, literally and figuratively, high school as a whole. He is also proud of improving his typing speed from 60 WPM to 80 WPM average. He is proud of beating Minecraft in less than 30 minutes. He is proud of surviving in [aimbooster](http://www.aimbooster.com/) for more than 1 minute and 30 seconds. He is proud of not being addicted to League of Legends. He is proud of being able to roll out of bed just in time for school.

## Surroundings

Andy is surrounded by his cute 5 year old brother who's about to turn 6 in a month. He is surrounded by his loving mother and supportive father. He also believes that he shouldn't be surrounded by too many people, especially considering that social distancing is still in effect.

## How to learn

Andy has recently realized that the way in which he learns is extremely toxic. He procrastinates until the last second until he absolutely must complete an assignment, abusing the [Temporal motivation theory (TMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_motivation_theory)
```tex
Motivation=\frac{Expectancy \times Value}{1+Impulsiveness\times Delay}
```
to skyrocket his movation as his `Delay` approaches `0`. 
He tries to use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize terms, but has not kept up to its schedule. In school, he mostly learns by reading, unable to learn by doing, due to how fast-paced the classes are. 

## How to spend freetime

Andy would like to spend freetime pursuing his passions: playing Minecraft, eating food, sleeping, or making a cool website. However, in the recent weeks he has been routinely dragged down the Youtube rabbit hole and thus does not currently have any freetime.
